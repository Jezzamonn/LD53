ðŸ‘‘: Those are some tall stairs! And unfortunately, unlike the moveRight and moveLeft function, the jump function has to be called for each jump. So we need to call the function 4 times.

ðŸ‘‘: The good news is there's a way to run code multiple times! It's called a loop!

ðŸ‘‘: In JavaScript, loops look like this:

for (var i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    jump()
}

ðŸ‘‘: Let me break that down:

â€¢ The first part is the 'for' keyword, which starts the loop
â€¢ Inside the parentheses, we have three statements, and have a semicolon ; between each one.
  â€¢ The first part is the code that runs at the start of the loop. Here, "var i = 0" creates a variable called i and sets it to 0
  â€¢ The second part is the code that is checked to see if the loop should keep going or not. Here, "i < 4" checks that the value of i is less than 4.
  â€¢ The third part is the code that runs each loop, after the code inside the curly-braces. Here, "i++" adds 1 to the value of i.

ðŸ‘‘: So, in the example, the loop will run 4 times because the value of i starts at 0, and each time the loop runs, 1 is added to the value of i. After the loop runs 4 times, i will be equal to 4, and so NOT less than 4, so the loop will end.

ðŸ‘‘: This particular pattern, of setting a variable to 0, checking if it's less than something, and adding 1 to it is very common in JavaScript.

ðŸ‘‘: That's a lot of information! If that seems to complicated, feel free to just call the function 4 times!
