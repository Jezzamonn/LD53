ðŸ‘‘: Another long hallway with stairs. Looks like each stair is exactly 2 tiles apart.

ðŸ‘‘: If you're feeling clever, you could try using a loop here! You can put multiple functions inside the curly-braces of the loop, like this:

for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    jump()
    moveLeft(2)
}

ðŸ‘‘: That example doesn't look right for this hallway though. Can you change it to work here?
