Commence: Mission Programmable

Communication Log:
👑: Hello operative. Welcome to Mission Programmable. I'm 👑Agent KB, and I'll be directing you what to do in this mission. The only way I can communicate is through the developer console here, so read carefully.

👑: Our mission is to deliver this package to the top level of this building. What looks like a normal package is actually our latest HI-TECH PROGRAMMABLE STEALTH BOT™️, and can be controlled by writing JavaScript code in the developer console here. In playing through this mission, you'll learn some beginner JavaScript coding!

👑: An introduction: JavaScript is a programming language used for controlling webpages. This game itself is created with JavaScript. In the developer console we can run code that will interact with the game.

👑: There are a few ways we can run code in JavaScript, one of the ways being functions. In JavaScript, you can "call" a function to make the webpage execute some code.

👑: The way you do that is by typing the name of the function, followed by parentheses, like this: moveRight()

👑: Try it out! Type moveRight() in the developer console and press enter. You should see the STEALTH BOT move right one space.
