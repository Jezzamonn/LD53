ðŸ‘‘: It's possible to put loops inside each other, when you want to run a loop multiple times. This is called a nested loop.

ðŸ‘‘: Here's an example:

for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    for (var j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
        jump();
    }
    moveRight(4);
}

ðŸ‘‘: In this example, the robot will jump 4 times, before moving to the left. Then all of THAT will happen 3 times.

ðŸ‘‘: Note that we used a different variable name for the inner loop. Each loop needs to have it's own variable name or the loops will interfere with each other.

ðŸ‘‘: Try the example here and let's see if we can get through this corridor!
