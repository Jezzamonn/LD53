ðŸ‘‘: Good job!

ðŸ‘‘: Here are some other functions you can call to control the game:

â€¢ mute() - Switch between playing music and sound effects, only sound effects, or no sound.
â€¢ restart() - Restarts a level.
â€¢ nextLevel() - If this level seems too hard, you can skip it!
â€¢ skipToEnd() - For Ludum Dare players: Skips all the way to the last level! Use this to make sure you try the ending before you rate the game. But preferably play through the game instead!

ðŸ‘‘: But anyway, we need to get to the elevator. Try calling moveRight() again to move to the elevator.
