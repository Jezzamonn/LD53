ðŸ‘‘: Stairs! Oh no, the mission is over! There's no way we can get past those!

ðŸ‘‘: Just kidding. Looks like you have a handy jump() function!

ðŸ‘‘: Another tip: You can put a semicolon between function calls to run more than one on the same line. For example:

moveRight(2); jump()

ðŸ‘‘: You can put as many next to each other as yoy want! Like so:

moveRight(2); jump(); moveLeft(2); jump()
