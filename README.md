Code utilities for Ludum Dare

These include:
- [asprite-js.ts](asprite-js.ts), An updated version of [aseprite-js](https://github.com/Jezzamonn/aseprite-js), but in TypeScript. I haven't fully documented it so just dumping it here
- [sounds.ts](sound.ts), Utilities for loading / playing sounds. Also allows sounds to be muted!
- [images.ts](images.ts), Utilities for loading images and waiting until they're loaded
- [keys.ts](keys.ts), Utilities for getting user keyboard input
- [util.ts](util.ts), General helpful utility functions. Lerp is probably the most useful, but the seeded random number generator is good too.
